      <h1>Web Design and Prototyping</h1>
      <p>I specialize in web design and prototyping, creating visually stunning and intuitive interfaces for websites and applications. Using the latest design tools and techniques, I craft mockups and prototypes that accurately represent the final product. My process ensures that the design aligns with the client’s vision and meets the end-users’ needs.</p>
      
      <h3>Visual Design</h3>
      <p>Creating visually appealing designs that are both modern and user-friendly, ensuring a positive user experience.</p>
      
      <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
      <p>Designing interfaces that work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent experience for all users.</p>
      
      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <p>Developing interactive prototypes that allow clients to visualize the final product and make informed decisions about design changes before development begins.</p>
      
      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>Conducting user testing sessions to gather feedback and insights, ensuring the design is intuitive and meets user expectations.</p>
      
      <h3>Iteration</h3>
      <p>Refining designs based on user feedback and client input, iterating on prototypes to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>
      
      <h3>Collaboration</h3>
      <p>Working closely with clients and development teams to ensure that the design is feasible and can be implemented effectively.</p>
      
      <h3>Design Tools</h3>
      <p>Utilizing industry-standard design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, and InVision to create and share design assets.</p>
      
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Ensuring designs are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following best practices and guidelines for accessibility.</p>
      
      <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">By leveraging these capabilities, I create designs that not only look great but also provide a seamless and enjoyable user experience.</p>
